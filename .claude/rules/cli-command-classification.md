# CLI Command Classification (`hooks/lib/zensu-mcp-tools.sh` + `hooks/lib/zensu-cli-map.sh`)

_Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`. Where this text says "this file" or names `CLAUDE.md`, it means the repository conventions as a whole: `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/rules/`._

The plugin drives Zensu through the typed `zensu` CLI (the MCP server still exists for the Zensu web app, but is no longer wired into the plugin). The write-gate now intercepts `zensu <noun> <verb>` Bash invocations rather than MCP tool calls.

**When the Zensu backend gains a new operation, two files move together:** classify the canonical tool name in `hooks/lib/zensu-mcp-tools.sh` (state-mutating → `ZENSU_MUTATION_TOOL_NAMES`; read/telemetry → the `zensu_is_read_tool` allowlist `ZENSU_READ_TOOL_PREFIXES` / `ZENSU_READ_TOOL_NAMES`), AND map its `zensu <noun> <verb>` CLI form to that tool name in `hooks/lib/zensu-cli-map.sh`.

`zensu-mcp-tools.sh` is the single source of truth for read/mutation classification, consumed by:

- `hooks/pre-bash-zensu-gate.sh` — the PreToolUse(Bash) write-gate: parses `zensu <noun> <verb>` from the command, resolves each via `zensu-cli-map.sh`, and classifies via this SoT — `zensu_is_read_tool` commands pass ungated, mutations are default-denied unless workflow-driven.
- `hooks/lib/zensu-cli-map.sh` — the CLI→tool-name adapter the gate and the marker test use. Its mutation entries stay a subset of `ZENSU_MUTATION_TOOL_NAMES`.
- `tests/structure/test-skill-workflow-markers.sh` — the build-time guard that fails if a skill runs a `zensu` mutation command (resolved via the map) without the `--workflow-begin` / `--workflow-end` markers.

Consequences of forgetting a new operation:

- **New mutation, not added to `ZENSU_MUTATION_TOOL_NAMES`:** the marker test will NOT flag a skill that runs it un-wrapped. **Test-coverage gap, not an open gate.**
- **New read, not added to the read-allowlist:** if the map resolves it to a name that classifies as a mutation, it is wrongly gated on the main thread until added.
- **New CLI verb, not added to `zensu-cli-map.sh`:** the gate cannot resolve it → treated as unknown/neutral → allowed ungated, so a mutating verb would slip the nudge. Add every new mutating verb to the map.

Invariant: `ZENSU_MUTATION_TOOL_NAMES` must stay a strict superset of every skill's `--workflow-begin --tools` declaration AND of every mutation the CLI map emits. `tests/structure/test-bash-zensu-gate.sh` + `test-skill-workflow-markers.sh` pin the read/mutation classification and the CLI-form detection.
