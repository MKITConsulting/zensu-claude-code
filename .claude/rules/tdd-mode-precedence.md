# TDD Mode Precedence (`hooks/lib/zensu-config.sh` + `zensu-log.sh --tdd-begin`)

_Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`. Where this text says "this file" or names `CLAUDE.md`, it means the repository conventions as a whole: `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/rules/`._

The strict/vanilla implementation mode is decided by a FOUR-RANK ladder, and
`hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh`'s `--tdd-begin` branch is the only place that orders all four
ranks:

1. the session marker `/zensu:tdd-mode` records (`hooks/lib/zensu-tdd-mode.sh` writes
   `<project>/.zensu/state/tdd-mode-<session-key>.json`)
2. `--tdd-begin --tdd-mode strict` — the CALLING SKILL's own default
3. `hooks.tddImplementation`
4. vanilla

**Rank 2 is escalation-only, and that removes the one downgrade spelling a gate can
see.** The value reaches the flag from a `TDD-MODE:` line in a model-read
specification, and a spec body is not always user-authored — `/zensu:pr-fix-findings`
builds one out of PR review-comment bodies. `strict` is therefore the only accepted
value; relaxing the discipline stays rank 1, the user's own action. Widening the
whitelist re-opens a downgrade channel that lands no bypass-ledger entry.

It NARROWS the channel rather than closing it: rank 1's carrier is an ordinary file in
the project tree, and NO gate covers it while the chain is inactive — not the Edit gate
(`pre-edit-tdd-reminder.sh` returns early on an inactive chain, ahead of its
`.zensu/state/` deny) and not the Bash source-write gate (`bash-source-write-parse.js`
carries no `.zensu` rule at all). Both an `Edit`/`Write` and a shell redirect therefore
reach `{"mode":"vanilla"}` ungated. The controls there are prose — "only the user
changes the mode", in `skills/tdd-mode/SKILL.md` and `skills/pr-fix-findings/SKILL.md`
— not a gate. Say so plainly, name both channels, and do not upgrade the claim:
hardening one gate would not close it.

**Rank 2 must outrank rank 3**, or the shipped `tddImplementation: false` makes every
skill default unreachable. **Rank 1 must outrank rank 2**, or a skill overrides the
user.

**Two sites FREEZE the resolved mode into a chain's `vanilla` flag**, and both resolve
the same ladder for every rank that exists there: `zensu-log.sh --tdd-begin` (ranks
1-4), and the Stop-hook adoption of a deferred review (`stop-chain-enforcer.sh`
`VANILLA_SEED` → `autopilot_adopt_pending_review` → `tdd_seed_deferred_review`), which
has no caller-flag carrier and therefore resolves 1 → 3 → 4. Accepted consequence: a
chain armed strict purely through rank 2 in a default-config project seeds its adopted
deferred-review generation vanilla. Everything downstream — the edit gate, the Stop legend,
`--mode` — reads the FROZEN flag and never the marker, so a mid-chain switch changes
nothing. Say "the next chain", never "this session".

**`/zensu:tdd-mode --status` is the ONE reader that consults both**, and it is not a
counter-example to the rule above — it exists to report the rule. It resolves the session
mode from the marker (ranks 1 → 3 → 4) and then reads the running chain's FROZEN flag via
`tdd_state_file` / `tdd_session_active` / `tdd_vanilla_mode`, appending a disclosure when
the two disagree. That makes it a fourth frozen-flag reader, so a change to the flag's
name, shape or accessors lands here as well as in the three above. It degrades to the
resolved-mode answer when the phase library cannot be sourced, because the source happens
after the base line is computed — a load fault loses the disclosure, never the mode.

**Effective vs configured is a deliberate split.** `plan-approved-delegate.sh`,
`user-prompt-tdd-reminder.sh` and the Stop seed call `zensu_tdd_strict_effective`
(marker over config); `session-start-banner.sh` and `session-start-primer.sh` stay on
`zensu_tdd_strict_enabled` BY DESIGN — at SessionStart no marker for the new session
can exist yet, so an "effective" read there would only ever return the config anyway.
A directive that names a cause must name the one that actually decided: after the
switch to the effective mode, the vanilla branches may not assert
`hooks.tddImplementation=false`.

Moving together with the ladder: `zensu_tdd_mode_marker_path` / `zensu_tdd_mode_state_linked`
/ `zensu_tdd_mode_marker_state` / `zensu_tdd_mode_override` / `zensu_tdd_strict_effective`
(the single path template and parse — the writer sources
them rather than re-spelling, unlike zen-mode, whose template is hand-copied into its
reader hook). `zensu_tdd_mode_marker_state` owns the marker VOCABULARY —
`strict|vanilla|released|none`, four values, where `released` is a present `{"mode":"auto"}`
and `none` is absence-or-unreadable — and it is the only owner of that vocabulary, while the
PARSE is `_zensu_marker_one_line_value`, ONE bounded reader shared with the delivery-route
marker (`.claude/rules/session-delivery-route.md`); `zensu_tdd_mode_override` is a
total reduction over it that collapses `released|none` to `auto`, so its callers keep a
three-value contract and the two cannot drift. `zensu_tdd_mode_state_linked` is the symlink
guard for the `.zensu` / state-dir / marker triple plus an optional extra leaf, and the WRITER
now calls the reader's copy rather than spelling its own. It guards BOTH marker pairs under a
name that predates the second one (reader `zensu_delivery_route_marker_state`, writer
`zensu-delivery-route.sh`); its pre-rename re-check is
deliberately a SECOND call, because that duplication is the TOCTOU defense and collapsing the
two would remove it. A new marker value lands in the reader, in the reduction, and in
`--status`'s label set. Then the `TDD-MODE:` producer (`skills/pr-fix-findings/SKILL.md`) and its parser
(`skills/tdd/SKILL.md` Phase 0 + Mandatory command protocol step 1), that same skill's
§"Vanilla Implementation Mode", which states the ladder a THIRD time for the model,
`skills/tdd-mode/SKILL.md`, `docs/configuration.md` (the `tddImplementation` row),
`docs/gates.md` §Activation, `docs/tdd-manager-workflow.md` §Vanilla implementation mode,
and `docs/architecture.md`. A site left behind does not fail closed — it leaves a stale
rank list the model reads while the helper resolves a different one.

**A second site re-encodes the ORDER**, not just the ladder's prose: `--status` in
`hooks/lib/zensu-tdd-mode.sh` resolves rank 1 → 3 → 4 itself to report provenance. It
is structurally blind to rank 2, and so are the two pre-begin directive hooks — a caller
flag exists only at the moment of arming. So `--status` can answer `vanilla (config)`
while the next `/zensu:pr-fix-findings` run legitimately arms strict; the `mode:` echo at
`--tdd-begin` is the only authoritative report. A new rank, or a fourth marker value,
lands in `--tdd-begin`, in `zensu_tdd_strict_effective` AND here.
`tests/structure/test-tdd-mode-toggle.sh` pins the ladder and the fail-safes;
`test-tdd-vanilla-mode.sh` E3/E3b pin that the freeze survives a marker flip.

**Known gap:** no `/zensu:doctor` row reports the marker or a chain's frozen `vanilla`
flag, so a session-scoped choice is visible only in the `--tdd-begin` echo and in
`/zensu:tdd-mode --status`. Do not claim doctor visibility until that row exists.
