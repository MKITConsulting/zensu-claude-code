# Bypass Ledger Read Contract (`tdd_bypasses`)

_Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`. Where this text says "this file" or names `CLAUDE.md`, it means the repository conventions as a whole: `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/rules/`._

`tdd_bypasses` is the ONE member of the `_tdd_read_validated_state` reader family
that signals an unreadable document through its EXIT STATUS rather than an echoed
sentinel. Its siblings — `tdd_state_status`, `tdd_get_flag`, `zensu_workflow_allows`,
`tdd_phase`, `tdd_step`, `tdd_has_red_fail`, `tdd_get_counter` — all stay total and
`return 0` with a value (`invalid`, `false`, `INVALID_STATE`, `0`, …). The divergence
is deliberate: this reader's value is rendered VERBATIM into the user-facing
`Gates bypassed during this session:` line, so a sentinel would be printed as if it
were a gate name. It returns **1** for a document that does not validate and **2**
for one that is absent, because a clean ENOENT at `--tdd-begin` is the ordinary
first-arming case and must not be reported as damage.

**No rendering site consumes that status directly.** `zensu_bypass_display`, beside the
constants in `hooks/lib/zensu-tdd-phase.sh`, owns the whole ladder — including a
catch-all that fails CLOSED on an unknown status, which three hand-rolled copies
previously got backwards by testing `-eq 1` and falling silent instead. Its second
argument decides ONLY what an absent document renders: `text` for a terminus that must
disclose (`--bypass-list`, the post-review delegate), the default `empty` for a clearing
verb (`--tdd-begin`, `--tdd-reset`) and for a Stop release, where a clean ENOENT means
nothing was ever recorded. It re-raises `tdd_bypasses`' status, so `--bypass-list` still
exits **3** on a non-zero read — distinct from its pre-existing exit 2 for an unavailable
session identity. `tdd_add_bypass`'s own dedupe is the one exception: it consumes the raw
value inside a `case` word and discards the status by design. Adding a sixth rendering
site means calling the helper, never re-rolling the mapping; both message constants live
beside `ZENSU_BYPASS_GATE_ALLOWLIST` and neither sentence may be hand-copied into a
consumer.

**A chain terminus and a Stop release are both disclosure points**, because a gate escape
needs no file change to be recorded — `ZENSU_TEST_WITNESS` and `ZENSU_MCP_GATE` are both
reachable without one, so a zero-change chain is exactly where an undisclosed escape would
hide. Four release paths therefore render the line themselves on **stderr**, the operator
channel every other Stop release message already uses: `ZENSU_CHAIN=off`,
`hooks.chainEnforcer=false`, the cap release after a chain fails to converge (all three via
`zensu_render_bypass_release` in `hooks/stop-chain-enforcer.sh`), and the `--chain-done`
verb itself via `zensu_render_terminus_bypasses` in `hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh`, which covers
both the standalone and the bound spelling so either entry point discloses. A new release
path added above the routing branches needs the same call.

**Operator-facing accounts that must move with this contract:** the "Visible opt-outs
(bypass ledger)" paragraph in `docs/configuration.md`, which is the AUTHORITATIVE residual
list — the other surfaces point at it rather than restating it, because three divergent
copies is exactly the drift this rule exists to prevent; the `## Open` rendering rules in
`skills/self-review/SKILL.md`; the build-union rule in `skills/autopilot/SKILL.md` and its
`templates/autopilot-pr-body.md` third value. `tests/structure/test-bypass-ledger.sh` pins
the first three; the template is not pinned by that suite.

**What the ledger proves is narrower than it reads.** Validation is STRUCTURAL:
`validateWorkflowState` checks shape plus a self-derivable `session_id_hash`, and the
`bypasses` array carries no MAC and no monotone counter. A document edited in place
but left schema-valid still reads `valid` and renders `none` — `test-bypass-ledger.sh`'s
P5y case performs exactly that read-modify-write and expects a valid result. Closing that
needs a persisted authenticity signal, which is a workflow-state schema field and
therefore a breaking minor under the Runtime Lineage rule; it is deliberately not
paid for. Say "what a readable document recorded", never "no gate was escaped".
