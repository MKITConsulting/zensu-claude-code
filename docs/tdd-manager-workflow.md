# TDD-Manager Workflow

End-to-end reference for `zensu:tdd-manager` — the Zensu plugin agent that drives strict Red/Green TDD with a PreToolUse phase gate.

---

## 1. Overview

**What it is.** A Claude Code subagent that takes a feature specification and produces working, tested code through a strict TDD discipline. It writes a plan, declares phase transitions (RED → IMPL → GREEN → REFACTOR), and is enforced by a PreToolUse hook that blocks edits which violate the cycle.

**When to invoke.**

```
Use the Agent tool with subagent_type='zensu:tdd-manager' and prompt: <feature spec>
```

The agent is also auto-spawned by the `ExitPlanMode` PostToolUse hook when the user approves a plan that adds executable code.

**Inputs.**

- A feature specification (free-form text, or a path to `evals/.../prompts/*.md` in eval context).
- Project context — the agent discovers tech stack, test commands, coverage tooling automatically.

**Outputs.**

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Plan | `.zensu/plans/{ts}_tdd-{slug}.md` | Design decisions, step table, preconditions, audit checklist |
| Log | `.zensu/logs/{ts}_tdd-{slug}.log` | Append-only execution trace, phase markers, attempts, audit results |
| State | `.zensu/state/tdd-phase-{session}.json` | Runtime FSM state (per session, ephemeral) |
| Source | test + implementation files | The actual code |
| Audit | included in log + final report | Build, coverage, mtime discipline, precondition drift |

The plan and log are durable repo artifacts. They are auto-staged and committed (see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) repo conventions).

---

## 2. Two-Level Mental Model

Two distinct phase concepts share the word "phase". Keep them separate.

**Workflow Phases (0-6)** — the agent's overall journey for a single task. Linear, one-shot per invocation.

**TDD-FSM phases** — per-step state that the PreToolUse hook reads from the state file. Cyclical, repeated for each step inside Phase 4.

Each step inside Workflow Phase 4 cycles the TDD-FSM through `RED_WRITE → RED_RUN → RED_FAIL → IMPL → GREEN_RUN → GREEN_PASS` (and optionally `REFACTOR`). When all steps complete, the agent advances to Workflow Phase 5.

|-------|------|-------------|
| 0. Pre-flight | Capture `SESSION_TS` + `SESSION_EPOCH`, create first task | session timestamps |
| 1. Discover Project | Read CLAUDE.md hierarchy, detect tech stack, test runners, coverage tool + threshold | tech-stack context |
| 1.5. Precondition Discovery | Enumerate every external CLI/secret/endpoint/fixture named by the spec, verify presence, escalate misses | Preconditions table in plan |
| 2. Plan + Log | Write plan markdown + initialize log file | plan + log on disk |
| 3. Create ALL Tasks | 3 tasks per TDD step (test/impl/verify) + 1 per integration step | TaskList populated |
| 4. Execute TDD Cycles | Per step: RED → IMPL → GREEN (+ REFACTOR if applicable) | source code + tests |
| 5. Checkpoint | Run full test suite + linter, batch-update plan statuses | checkpoint log entry |
| 6. Audit & Final Report | Build verification, coverage, mtime discipline, precondition drift audit, summary | audit log + final report |

See [agents/tdd-manager.md](../agents/tdd-manager.md) for the canonical phase definitions.

## 4. Per-Step TDD-FSM

Inside Phase 4, each step cycles through a small state machine. The PreToolUse hook ([hooks/pre-edit-tdd-reminder.sh](../hooks/pre-edit-tdd-reminder.sh)) reads the current phase from the state file and allows or denies Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool calls based on it.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> UNINITIALIZED
    UNINITIALIZED --> RED_WRITE: zensu-log.sh --phase RED_WRITE
    RED_WRITE --> RED_RUN: --phase RED_RUN
    RED_RUN --> RED_FAIL: test FAILS (correct RED)
    RED_RUN --> RED_WRITE: test PASSES (fake-green, rewrite)
    RED_FAIL --> IMPL: --phase IMPL
    IMPL --> GREEN_RUN: --phase GREEN_RUN
    GREEN_RUN --> GREEN_PASS: test PASSES
    GREEN_RUN --> IMPL: test FAILS (retry, max 3)
    GREEN_PASS --> REFACTOR: --phase REFACTOR (optional)
    GREEN_PASS --> [*]: next step
    REFACTOR --> [*]: next step

    note right of UNINITIALIZED
      Hook denies all Edit/Write
    end note
    note right of RED_FAIL
      Hook allows test paths only
    end note
    note right of IMPL
      Hook allows iff RED_FAIL
      for this step in history
    end note
    note right of GREEN_PASS
      Hook allows test paths only
      (no prod edits without REFACTOR)
    end note
```

Phase transitions are recorded by invoking the log helper:

```bash
bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh --phase {PHASE} --step {step_id} [--reason "..."]
```

The helper writes both a log line and updates the state file under a `flock` (or `mkdir`-based fallback) mutex.

---

## 5. Hook Gate Behavior

The PreToolUse hook fires on `Edit | Write | MultiEdit` tool calls. It allows or denies based on `(phase, file path type)`.

| Phase | Production file edit | Test file edit |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| `UNINITIALIZED` | DENY | DENY |
| `RED_WRITE` | ALLOW | ALLOW |
| `RED_RUN` | (transient, no edits expected) | (transient) |
| `RED_FAIL` | DENY | ALLOW |
| `IMPL` | ALLOW iff this step has `RED_FAIL` in history | ALLOW |
| `GREEN_RUN` | (transient) | (transient) |
| `GREEN_PASS` | DENY | ALLOW |
| `REFACTOR` | ALLOW | ALLOW |

**Test-path detection** ([hooks/lib/zensu-tdd-phase.sh::tdd_is_test_path](../hooks/lib/zensu-tdd-phase.sh)):

1. Path prefix match: `**/test/**`, `**/tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**`, `**/spec/**`, `**/specs/**`, plus top-level variants (case-insensitive)
2. Basename match: `_test.*`, `*_test.*`, `.test.*`, `.tests.*`, `.spec.*`, `.specs.*`, `_spec.*`, `_specs.*`
3. Hard-link rejection: files with link count > 1 fail closed (prevents `ln target.test.ts innocent.ts` bypass)
4. Symlink rejection: `[ -L "$path" ]` → not a test
5. Inline-header sniff (last resort): read first 20 lines, strip BOM, match `^(func Test|describe\(|it\(|test\(|@Test|def test_|#\[test\]|#\[cfg\(test\)\])`. Comment-prefix lines like `// describe(` are NOT matched (anchored at line start, no leading comment chars).

**Hook scope.** The gate is active **only** when `CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE=zensu:tdd-manager`. For any other actor (main thread, other subagents, plain CLI) the hook exits 0 silently and lets the action through. This is a deliberate trust-boundary: the gate provides in-moment reminders for the tdd-manager subagent, not bulletproofing against malicious actors.

---

## 6. Environment Variables

| Variable | Where set | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE` | Claude-code harness sets it on subagent spawn. Eval wrapper [scripts/claude-promptfoo-wrapper.sh](../scripts/claude-promptfoo-wrapper.sh) explicitly exports it for propagation. | Gate active only when value is `zensu:tdd-manager`. Anything else = pass-through. |
| `ZENSU_TDD_GATE` | User sets in shell | Set to `off` to bypass the gate entirely for legitimate non-TDD edits (docs, config, one-offs). |
| `ZENSU_HOOK_LOG` | Eval wrapper sets per isolated test dir | Opt-in mirror of denial reasons. Hook writes 4 lines (`TDD-Phase-Gate`, `Current phase:`, `Expected:`, `permissionDecision=deny`) on denial. Empty file in production. |
| `TDD_STATE_DIR` | Caller may override | State file location. Default `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.zensu/state`. |
| `TDD_DISABLE_FLOCK` | Test fixture sets | Test-only. Forces the `mkdir`-fallback mutex path (exercises stale-lock recovery on Linux/CI where `flock` is present). |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | Claude-code harness | Root for relative state paths. |

## 7. Files Produced Per Task

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Inputs
      Spec[Feature Spec]
    end
    subgraph Plan_Phase[Phase 2: Plan + Log]
      Plan[.zensu/plans/<br/>ts_tdd-slug.md]
      Log[.zensu/logs/<br/>ts_tdd-slug.log]
    end
    subgraph Runtime_State[Phase 4: Runtime State]
      State[.zensu/state/<br/>tdd-phase-session.json<br/>rounds-session.json<br/>session-id-PPID_prochash.txt]
    end
    subgraph Production[Phase 4: Production Artifacts]
      Tests[test files]
      Code[implementation files]
    end
    Spec --> Plan
    Spec --> Log
    Plan --> State
    Log --> State
    State --> Tests
    State --> Code
```

The plan + log files form a durable audit pair. State files are ephemeral per session. All three live under `.zensu/` and are auto-staged for commit per repo convention.

Per-session state files (`tdd-phase-<session>.json`, `rounds-<session>.json`, `session-id-<PPID>_<prochash>.txt`) are all project-local under `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.zensu/state/` by default since 0.3.23 (0.3.20 attempted this but the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` fallback was unreachable inside claude-code — fixed in 0.3.23 by introducing a new opt-in `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE` env var and ignoring claude-code's auto-set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`). Power-users can still relocate the rounds counter via `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE` (e.g. `$HOME/.zensu/state` to centralize across worktrees). The SessionStart `session-id-*.txt` cache enables 3-tier session-id resolution (stdin → cache → `fallback_<key>` deterministic fallback) so a missing `session_id` payload no longer collides on a literal `unknown` bucket.

## 8. Discipline Patches — User-Visible Behaviors

These are the guardrails that protect users from common TDD failure modes. Each is pinned by structure tests in [tests/structure/](../tests/structure/).

| Patch | What it does | User benefit |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **1. Rationalization Counters** | Three patterns recognized as agent self-deception: "I'll just write a quick replacement", "I'll commit a placeholder fixture", "user said no questions so I'll guess". Each is labeled a LIE in the agent prompt. | Agent doesn't talk itself into corner-cutting. |
| **2. Hard Ban on substitution** | Forbids substituting a missing required dependency with a hand-rolled equivalent without explicit user approval. | No silent `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` workarounds. No fake adapters. |
| **3. Phase 1.5 Precondition Discovery** | Enumerates every external CLI/secret/endpoint/fixture named in the spec, verifies presence, and on missing → AskUserQuestion (install / substitute / skip). Overrides any prior "no questions" instruction. | Agent stops and asks BEFORE damaging your workspace with placeholder values. |
| **4. Preconditions table in plan** | Plan template includes `## Preconditions` section listing every dependency + verification + user decision. | Auditable record of what was assumed present. |
| **5. Per-step precondition gate** | If a step's IMPL plan references a precondition marked `skip`, the step gets `[!]` status and is bypassed. No partial test, no placeholder. | Skipped dependencies don't leak into half-broken implementations. |
| **6. Phase 6 Precondition Drift Audit** | Greps the log for the contracted tool name versus the user-named substitute. Flags `PRECONDITION DRIFT — {tool}: decision={d}, actual={observed}` when reality diverges from the plan. | Catches silent substitution after the fact. |
| **7. Claude-code CLI promptfoo provider** | Wrapper [scripts/claude-promptfoo-wrapper.sh](../scripts/claude-promptfoo-wrapper.sh) invokes local `claude` as promptfoo `exec:` provider. APFS `cp -cR` per-test isolation. | Eval suite runs without an API key, isolated per test, deterministic. |
| **8. Hook event mirror** | Opt-in via `ZENSU_HOOK_LOG`. Hook writes denial reason lines into the log when the gate fires. | Eval assertions can verify gate behavior without reading hook stderr. |
| **9. FSM state enrichment** | Wrapper appends `===== fsm state =====` block (jq-scraped from state file) to its output. | Eval assertions see the phase history. |
| **B. CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE export** | Wrapper explicitly `export`s the env var before exec'ing claude. | Hook fires in subagent context where the harness doesn't propagate it natively. |

---

## 9. Auto-Review Chain

After Phase 6 completes, the `PostToolUse` hook on the `Agent` matcher ([hooks/hooks.json](../hooks/hooks.json)) automatically spawns `zensu:code-reviewer`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P6[Phase 6 complete] --> Hook[PostToolUse on Agent]
    Hook --> Reviewer[zensu:code-reviewer<br/>5 perspectives:<br/>conventions, bugs,<br/>architecture, tests, security]
    Reviewer --> Findings{Critical or<br/>Important?}
    Findings -->|Yes| Fix[zensu:tdd-manager<br/>auto-fix]
    Fix --> Reviewer
    Findings -->|None or<br/>max rounds| Done([Final Report])

    style Reviewer fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#1e40af,color:#1e293b
    style Fix fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#1e40af,color:#1e293b
```

Reviewer returns findings in three tiers:

- **Critical**: blocks ship. Auto-fix attempted.
- **Important**: should land before merge. Auto-fix attempted.
- **Suggestions**: nice-to-have. NOT auto-fixed.

Auto-fix loop runs up to 5 rounds (configurable via `autoFixMaxRounds` in plugin settings). On the 5th round, the harness emits "max rounds reached, manual fix required" and stops — preventing infinite loops on intractable findings.

**Chain-end combined summary.** At every chain-end branch — PASS / zero findings, suggestions-only stop, and max-rounds convergence — `hooks/post-review-tdd-delegate.sh` appends a `CHAIN-END SUMMARY` directive to its `additionalContext` output. The main agent then renders a three-section summary block: `## Implementation Summary` (what tdd-manager built — feature title, files modified, tests created, build status, mtime audit verdict, coverage status, plan + log paths), `## Review Summary` (final reviewer verdict, findings count by severity, files reviewed), and `## Auto-fix History` (per-round trace of findings routed to tdd-manager and what was fixed; skipped when zero rounds). This replaces the prior terse-stop behavior so the user retains visibility into the full chain. Controlled by `hooks.combinedSummary` in `~/.zensu/config.json` (default `true`; set `false` to restore terse stop). Contrast `autoFixIncludeSuggestions` which defaults to disabled — `combinedSummary` defaults the other way.

---

## 10. Four-Channel Logging Contract

Every TDD-Manager task writes to four channels:

| Channel | What | Lifetime | Format |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| **Plan** | Design decisions, step table, Preconditions, audit checklist | Durable (git-committed) | Markdown |
| **Log** | Execution trace: phase markers (`RED_WRITE`, `RED_FAIL`, `IMPL`, `GREEN_PASS`, `REFACTOR`), attempt counts, audit results | Durable (git-committed) | Append-only timestamped text |
| **State** | Current FSM phase per session, history array | Ephemeral per session | JSON |
| **Witness** | Independent record of every Bash tool invocation (cmd, exit code, stdout tail) | Ephemeral per session (per-test isolated dir under promptfoo) | Append-only timestamped text, JSON-escaped fields |

The agent appends to the log via:

```bash
printf '%s%s\n' "$(bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh timestamp $SESSION_EPOCH)" "<message>" >> {log_file}
```

The helper resolves the user's configured `logging.timestampStyle` (`wall`, `relative`, or `none`) so the log format is consistent across runs. Do not inline `$(date +%H:%M:%S)` — that bypasses the user's preference.

Phase transitions are atomic:

```bash
bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh --phase {PHASE} --step {step_id} [--reason "{reason}"]
```

This writes a log line AND updates the state file in a single critical section (under `flock` or mkdir-mutex), preventing concurrent-write races between parallel agents.

### Witness channel — anti-hallucination evidence

The witness log at `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.zensu/logs/witness-<session>.log` is written automatically by the `hooks/post-bash-witness.sh` PostToolUse hook on every Bash tool call. The hook is scoped to `CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE=zensu:tdd-manager` (no other actor records witness lines) and can be disabled with `ZENSU_TEST_WITNESS=off`.

Each line has the form:

```
[HH:MM:SS] BASH cmd="<JSON-escaped command>" exit=<rc|?> tail="<JSON-escaped last 200 chars of stdout>"
```

The witness log is the source of truth for Phase 5/6 cross-checks. The agent prompt mandates that every test/lint/build run logged in Phase 5 (`CHECKPOINT — cmd="X" exit=N result="..."`) and Phase 6 (`AUDIT — cmd="X" exit=N result="..."`) use the literal command string sent to the Bash tool. Phase 6 step 1 then runs `grep -F -q 'cmd="X"' witness.log` for each claim; an unmatched claim becomes `EVIDENCE GAP — cmd="X" claimed but not in witness log` and marks Phase 6 NOT complete.

Non-Bash test invocations (rare; e.g. an MCP test runner) use the `via=tool_name claim="..."` escape clause instead of `cmd="..."`. Audit treats `via=` as a known-limit (no cross-check possible) and surfaces it prominently in the final report.
