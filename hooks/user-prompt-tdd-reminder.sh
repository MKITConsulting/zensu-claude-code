# UserPromptSubmit hook — model-facing, per-turn TDD reminder for DIRECT
# (non-Plan-mode) implementation requests. The only other TDD trigger is the
# Plan-mode path (plan-approved-delegate.sh, PostToolUse on ExitPlanMode); a
# direct "implement X" / "fix the bug" prompt never reaches a plan approval, so
# nothing asks about TDD and the agent just starts editing. This hook re-states
# the convention every turn — with NO prompt regex — and lets the (multilingual)
# model decide whether the request is a code change and ask about TDD
# accordingly. It mirrors plan-approved-delegate.sh's decision logic + fast-paths
# so the direct path and the Plan-mode path stay behaviorally identical (the
# fast-path phrase lists are intentionally hook-specific supersets — the plan
# hook also matches approval-message phrasings like 'no tdd-manager').
#
# Silent when: the tddReminder flag is off, the payload has no prompt, or a TDD
# session is already active for this session (the Plan-mode/TDD flows own the
# reminder there). The active-session check reuses the exact session resolution
# from pre-edit-tdd-reminder.sh; any failure falls through to firing (fail-open
# toward the reminder). Advisory steering only — it never blocks an edit.

Fast-paths that skip the question: the request already states an EXPLICIT TDD preference — an affirmation matching 'use tdd', 'with tdd', 'tdd please', 'mit tdd', 'tdd bitte' (run TDD without asking) or a negation matching 'no tdd', 'skip tdd', \"don't use tdd\", 'kein tdd', 'ohne tdd' (implement directly without asking); or you are running non-interactively in Auto Mode / headless with no human to answer (default to running TDD, do NOT ask). Generic action phrases ('go', 'go ahead', 'start now', 'implement', 'mach mal', 'los gehts', 'jetzt umsetzen') are NOT a TDD preference — ask anyway.
