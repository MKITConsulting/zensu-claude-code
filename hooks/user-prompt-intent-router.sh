    "additionalContext": "This prompt contains a product/planning keyword, so it MIGHT be a Zensu product-planning or product-tracking request — or it might just be ordinary work that mentions such a word. FIRST decide which. If the user genuinely wants to plan, track, bootstrap, scan, or manage features / roadmap / journeys / tiers in Zensu: delegate to the zensu-plm agent rather than calling Zensu MCP tools directly, and run the project-context triage — ASK, do NOT guess: (1) is the code already built, or are you starting fresh? (2) is there a plan, vision, or spec document? (3) if both exist, does the plan describe items not yet built? Then route per the zensu-plm Decision Rules: fresh code + plan doc -> bootstrap (greenfield); built code + no plan -> ghost-scan (brownfield); built code + plan with unbuilt items -> hybrid. This triage is READ-ONLY and is ALLOWED in Plan mode — do NOT defer it on a 'no writes yet' basis. If instead this is an ordinary implementation, coding, UI, design, debugging, refactor, or content task that merely contains a word like 'product', 'feature', or 'tier' (for example 'add a modern hero section to my landing page', 'add a feature flag to checkout', 'optimize the cache tier latency'): IGNORE this notice entirely and answer the request normally — do NOT mention zensu-plm, do NOT run the triage. This is advisory steering, not a hard gate."
