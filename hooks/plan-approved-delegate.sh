# PostToolUse hook fired when ExitPlanMode succeeds (= user approved plan).
# Returns JSON via stdout that Claude Code injects as additionalContext
# next to the tool result. By default (autoTdd enabled) the directive tells
# the main agent to ASK the user — via the AskUserQuestion tool — whether to
# run the strict /zensu:tdd flow for this plan, then act on the answer IN THE
# MAIN THREAD (no subagent): run /zensu:tdd on yes, implement directly on no.
# Fast-paths skip the question — doc-only plans, an explicit TDD preference
# already stated in the approval message, and non-interactive Auto Mode
# (which defaults to /zensu:tdd because there is no human to answer).
#
# This is a command-type hook (not prompt-type) so the directive reaches
# the main agent verbatim instead of being summarized by a judge LLM.

README/CHANGELOG edits are ALWAYS in this category, even when adding markers, sections, or restructuring. (B) the user's approval message already states an EXPLICIT TDD preference — either a negation matching 'no tdd', 'skip tdd', 'no tdd-manager', \"don't use tdd\", 'direct edit', 'kein tdd', 'ohne tdd-manager' (then skip TDD, implement directly, begin with 'Skipping TDD: user opted out'), or an affirmation matching 'use tdd', 'with tdd', 'tdd please', 'mit tdd', 'tdd bitte' (then run TDD without asking).

Do NOT call Read, Edit, Write, Bash, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Glob, or Grep before that AskUserQuestion call.

If the user chooses No → implement the plan directly in this main thread; the TDD phase-gate stays inactive (never run --tdd-begin) so your edits flow freely; begin that message with 'Skipping TDD: user declined'. Generic action phrases ('go ahead', 'start now', 'implement', 'gleich arbeiten', 'los gehts', 'immediately', 'mach mal', 'jetzt umsetzen', 'go') are NOT a TDD preference — ask anyway. If uncertain whether the plan adds executable code, ask."
