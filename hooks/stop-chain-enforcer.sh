# Stop hook — guarantees the post-implementation review chain runs to completion
# in the main-thread TDD model.
#
# In the old subagent model the reviewer auto-spawn was hook-enforced by the
# tdd-manager subagent's Agent-tool completion (post-tdd-review-delegate.sh).
# With TDD running in the MAIN thread that completion event no longer exists, so
# this Stop hook is the replacement hard backstop: it refuses to let the main
# agent end its turn while a TDD session has finished implementation
# (chain-state implComplete=true) but the review/auto-fix chain has not
# terminated (chainDone=true). Coordinates with post-review-tdd-delegate.sh,
# which sets chainDone at PASS / max-rounds.
#
# Activation: only when chain-state `active` is true for THIS session. Other
# sessions, non-TDD work, and plain CLI stop normally.
#
# Escapes:
#   ZENSU_CHAIN=off                 -> never block
#   hooks.chainEnforcer=false       -> disable via ~/.zensu/config.json
#   stop-block budget exceeded      -> allow stop + stderr warning (anti-deadlock)
