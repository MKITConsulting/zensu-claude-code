# PostToolUse hook fired when the Agent (code-reviewer) tool completes.
# Filters on subagent_type == "zensu:code-reviewer" and routes findings back to
# the MAIN agent (which runs the /zensu:tdd workflow in-thread) via
# additionalContext. On PASS / suggestions-only the main agent closes the chain
# with `zensu-log.sh --chain-done`; on max-rounds this hook sets chainDone
# itself so the Stop-hook backstop releases.
#
# Behavior is configurable via ~/.zensu/config.json (resolution order: env,
# project-local, global):
#   hooks.autoFixIncludeSuggestions=true  -> route ALL severities
#   hooks.autoFixIncludeSuggestions=false -> route Critical+Important only (default, backward-compat)
#   hooks.autoFixMaxRounds=<int 1..99>    -> loop guard (default 5)
#
# Counter state lives at ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.zensu/state}/rounds-<session_id>.json. claude-code's auto-set CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA is intentionally IGNORED (use CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE to relocate).
