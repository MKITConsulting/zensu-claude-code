# PostToolUse hook fired when the Agent (code-reviewer) tool completes.
# Filters on subagent_type == "zensu:code-reviewer" and routes findings back to
# the MAIN agent (which runs the /zensu:tdd workflow in-thread) via
# additionalContext. On PASS / suggestions-only the main agent closes the chain
# with `zensu-log.sh --chain-done`; on max-rounds this hook sets chainDone
# itself so the Stop-hook backstop releases.
#
# Behavior is configurable via ~/.zensu/config.json (resolution order: env,
# project-local, global):
#   hooks.autoFixIncludeSuggestions=true  -> route ALL severities
#   hooks.autoFixIncludeSuggestions=false -> route Critical+Important only (default, backward-compat)
#   hooks.autoFixMaxRounds=<int 1..99>    -> loop guard (default 5)
#
# Counter state lives at ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.zensu/state}/rounds-<session_id>.json. claude-code's auto-set CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA is intentionally IGNORED (use CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_OVERRIDE to relocate).

For each: what it does in plain words, its status (done / merged / built-tested), and a PR link if one exists. Carry the audit facts here: feature title, files modified, tests created, build status (passed / skipped / failed), mtime audit verdict, coverage status. Cite the plan + log file paths. When the session plan carries a ## Requirements table, also give per-requirement status keyed by its stable IDs (AC-###/FR-###: met / partial / dropped).\n\n## How I built it\nThe method and the review trail. State the TDD discipline followed, then the final zensu:code-reviewer verdict (PASS / PASS with suggestions / max-rounds reached) with findings count by severity and files reviewed. Then the auto-fix history: list EVERY review round 1..N — including rounds that fixed nothing. For each round give the round number and either the findings fixed in-thread (what changed, what remains), OR — for a verification round with no findings — mark it explicitly as PASS — 0 findings, nothing to fix. Always include the final clean verification round so the reader sees the chain converged with every finding addressed. At least one review round always ran.\n\n## Open\nWhat is left: any deferred suggestions (the buffered ### Suggestions block) or max-rounds findings requiring manual fix, plus the next step. If nothing is open, say so in one line.\n\n## TL;DR\nExactly ONE sentence, and it MUST be the last section: what shipped and the test verdict.'
