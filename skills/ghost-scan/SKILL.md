# /zensu:ghost-scan

Scan an existing repository to discover undocumented features, then review and import them into Zensu as tracked features with linked tests, docs, and source files.

## When to Use

This is the **brownfield** entry point — an existing codebase whose features are not yet tracked.

- Importing an existing codebase into Zensu for the first time
- Discovering undocumented features in a repository
- Linking tests, docs, and source files to newly created features

**Greenfield instead?** No code yet, just a plan/vision doc → use `/zensu:bootstrap`.

**Hybrid (existing code *and* a forward-looking plan doc)?** Run this scan first to import what is built — each discovered feature is seated at a v1 baseline revision (Stage 1) — then create the plan's not-yet-built items as `planned` features. No separate skill; see Phase 6.

## Prerequisites

- Zensu MCP Server connected (plugin auto-configures via `.mcp.json`)
- `ZENSU_API_KEY` environment variable set
- Product ID known (create one first with `/zensu:bootstrap` if needed)
- Working in the repository root (or a subdirectory)

## Workflow

Execute these phases in order. Present results to the user after each phase and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

**Workflow gate (first + last action).** As the VERY FIRST action, run `bash "$(cat "$HOME/.zensu/plugin-root")/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh" --workflow-begin`. This marks the Zensu product workflow active so the MCP write-gate (`hooks.mcpGate`, default-on) recognizes this skill's `ghost_apply` / `create_feature` calls as workflow-driven rather than freelance and does not block them. As the VERY LAST action (after the final phase, or on early exit), run `bash "$(cat "$HOME/.zensu/plugin-root")/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh" --workflow-end`.

### Phase 1: Setup & Context

1. Confirm the product ID via `list_products`
2. Call `list_features` with `product_id` and `view=compact` to load existing feature slugs
3. Show existing features to the user: "These features already exist and will not be suggested again"
4. Call `list_journeys` with `product_id` to load existing journeys for dedup: "These journeys already exist and will not be re-suggested." This feeds the Phase 2b journey-analyst lens and Phase 5.
5. **Resume check:** Call `ghost_get_candidates` to check for open scans. If a scan in "review" status exists, ask the user whether to resume or start a new scan
6. Confirm the repo path and branch

### Phase 2: Repo Analysis & Candidate Extraction

1. Walk the file tree with periodic feedback: "Analyzing auth/ (15 files)... Analyzing users/ (8 files)..."
2. Skip these directories: `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `.next/`, `build/`, `target/`
3. Identify file types:
   - **Test files:** `*_test.go`, `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `test_*.py`, `*_spec.rb`, `*.spec.ts`
   - **Source files:** `*.go`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.py`, `*.java`, `*.rs` (excluding test files)
   - **Doc files:** `README*`, `docs/**/*.md`, `*.rst`, `CHANGELOG*`
4. Group files by module/package and extract feature candidates
5. **Populate each candidate's three detection arrays — `detectedSourceFiles`, `detectedTestFiles`, `detectedDocFiles`.** These arrays are the *only* data `ghost_apply` uses to link artifacts — it links exactly what you pass, so an empty array links zero. Never leave `detectedTestFiles` empty by omission: an empty array must mean "globbed and found none," not "skipped." Note: `detectedDocFiles` links **existing** doc files in the repo (READMEs, `docs/*.md`) — it does not generate new documentation. Authoring new wiki docs for discovered features is a separate, code-grounded task: see `docs/documentation-guide.md` (read the source, never dump feature metadata).
6. **Tests are co-located — glob them per candidate.** Tests live in the same directories as a feature's source files. For each candidate, after collecting `detectedSourceFiles`, glob the test-file patterns from step 3 within those same directories *and* their sibling test dirs (`test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `specs/`), and assign every match to that candidate's `detectedTestFiles`. A capability feature spanning multiple modules collects tests from all of its source dirs.
7. **Docs are co-located too — glob them per candidate.** Apply the same rigor to docs as to tests: for each candidate, glob the doc-file patterns from step 3 (`README*`, `docs/**/*.md`, `*.rst`, `CHANGELOG*`) in the candidate's source dirs and the repo root, and assign every match to `detectedDocFiles`. Linking existing docs is first-class scan data, not a bonus — an empty `detectedDocFiles` must mean "globbed and found none," not "skipped."
8. **For large repos (>500 files):** Scan only top-level modules, max 3 directory levels deep. Ask the user if a deeper subdirectory scan is desired. Still glob the test and doc dirs at each scanned level — capping breadth must not silently drop tests or docs.
9. Filter candidates against existing features from Phase 1 to avoid duplicates
10. If a candidate matches an existing feature slug, **reuse the exact existing slug** — this enables enrichment during apply
11. Present candidates to the user as a table — do NOT submit yet, let the user review first
12. The user can edit, remove, or add candidates before submission

#### Candidate Quality Rules

**Feature-level, not function-level:**
- Prefer domain-level grouping: `authentication` instead of `auth-login`, `auth-register`, `auth-logout`
- If multiple packages share a domain concept, propose one feature, not several
- Minimum 3 source files for a feature (otherwise likely a utility)
- When in doubt, fewer and broader features — the user can split later with `split_feature`

**Test-file completeness (treat like the source-file rule, not a bonus):**
- Every candidate that has source files MUST have its co-located tests detected (Phase 2, step 6). Populate `detectedTestFiles` with the same rigor as `detectedSourceFiles`.
- An empty `detectedTestFiles` is acceptable ONLY after globbing the candidate's source dirs confirms genuinely zero tests — never as a default for "didn't look."
- Shared/helper tests that map to no single feature (e.g. `app.controller.spec.ts`, `helpers/*.spec.ts`) may stay unlinked or attach to a shell/account feature — do not force them onto an unrelated candidate.

**Doc-file completeness (treat like the test-file rule, not a bonus):**
- Every candidate MUST have its co-located docs detected (Phase 2, step 7). Populate `detectedDocFiles` with the same rigor as `detectedTestFiles` — `ghost_apply` links exactly what you pass, so an omitted array links zero docs.
- An empty `detectedDocFiles` is acceptable ONLY after globbing the candidate's source dirs + repo root confirms genuinely zero docs — never as a default for "didn't look."
- `detectedDocFiles` links **existing** docs only (READMEs, `docs/*.md`). It never generates new documentation — authoring docs for a feature with zero docs is a separate task flagged in Phase 6 (see `docs/documentation-guide.md`).

**Never create candidates for:**
- CI/CD configuration (`.github/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`)
- Build tooling (`Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- Linting/formatting (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `golangci.yml`)
- IDE settings (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Package manager locks (`go.sum`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- Vendor/dependencies (`vendor/`, `node_modules/`)

#### Confidence Score Heuristic

Confidence scores are heuristic estimates, not ML predictions. Use them to prioritize review, not as ground truth.

| Tier | Range | Criteria |
|------|-------|----------|
| High | >= 0.7 | Dedicated tests + clear module boundary (own package) |
| Medium | 0.4-0.7 | Either tests OR docs present, or clear boundary without tests |
| Low | < 0.4 | No tests, no docs, unclear boundary |

Building blocks:
- Dedicated test files: +0.3
- Documentation present: +0.2
- Clear directory boundary (own package/module, >= 3 source files): +0.3
- README mention or config reference: +0.2
- Single file / unclear boundary: -0.2
- Utils/helpers/infrastructure code: -0.3

#### Security Classification

Classify each candidate by **what data the feature itself reads or writes** — not by its
directory name or the product domain. Path is a weak hint; data sensitivity is the rule.
**Never default to `internal` for un-triaged code.** Present each suggestion to the user for
verification.

- `restricted`: handles credentials, keys, secrets, auth config, health data, or
  regulatory-controlled data (key management, auth/session, security tooling, compliance exports).
- `confidential`: directly reads or writes PII, customer business data, financial records, or
  personal data (user profiles, payments, roadmaps, journeys, product/feature data, org
  membership). **This is the bulk of a typical product** — when a feature touches customer data
  and you are unsure between `internal` and `confidential`, choose `confidential`.
- `internal`: requires standard auth but handles **no** PII or secrets — pure infra/ops surfaces
  (health checks, app shell, log viewers, aggregate-only dashboards). A feature that only displays
  aggregated data is `internal` even if a sibling that writes the underlying records is `confidential`.
- `public`: exposes no sensitive data and needs no auth (landing pages, public docs, blog,
  status pages).

If a candidate is genuinely un-triageable at scan time, leave `securityClassification` unset —
`ghost_apply` fails safe to `confidential` (review-gated), never `internal`.

### Phase 2b: Multi-Perspective Deep Analysis (fan-out)

The single-pass walk in Phase 2 is only a **seed**. A lone heuristic pass misses
features that span modules, live behind entry points, or are only legible from
tests, data models, or docs. Augment it — never replace it — with a parallel
fan-out of read-only analysis lenses, then consolidate in this main thread. This
is the house pattern already used by `/zensu:plan-review` and `/zensu:tdd` Phase 6.

1. **Spawn the lenses in ONE parallel batch.** Use the `Agent` tool with
   `subagent_type: Explore` (read-only — the lenses cannot mutate the repo or the
   scan). Each agent gets: the repo path, the Phase 2 seed candidates, the existing
   features (dedup), the existing journeys (dedup, from Phase 1), its single lens
   focus, and the per-lens output schema below. This is the one sanctioned parallel
   batch of the workflow; everything else stays sequential.
2. **Adaptive lens count (cap 12).** Scale the roster to repo size so small repos
   stay cheap and large repos get full coverage:
   - `< 150 files` → ~4 lenses
   - `150–500 files` → ~8 lenses
   - `> 500 files` → up to the full 12
   Core lenses are ALWAYS cast regardless of size: **domain-boundary**,
   **test-mapper**, **journey-analyst**, **docs-coverage**.
3. **Lens roster (up to 12):**

   | Lens | Looks for |
   |------|-----------|
   | domain-boundary | user-facing domains from READMEs + package structure |
   | test-mapper | behaviors from test names/structure → feature clusters; fills `detectedTestFiles` gaps |
   | cross-module capability | features spanning multiple directories |
   | API/entry-point surface | routes, controllers, CLI commands, events, public exports |
   | data-model | schemas, migrations, domain entities |
   | journey-analyst | entry points + personas → ordered user paths → draft journeys |
   | security-surface | auth/crypto/PII → `securityClassification` |
   | config/integration | external integrations, webhooks, env contracts |
   | docs-coverage | README / `docs/**` near each candidate → `detectedDocFiles` + gap flags |
   | perf/runtime | background jobs, caches, queues → infra features |
   | error-handling/observability | logging, metrics, error paths |
   | persona-split | refine journeys per persona (admin vs end-user vs API consumer) |

4. **Per-lens output schema.** Each agent returns: missed features, merge/split
   suggestions, refined boundaries, per-candidate `detectedSourceFiles` /
   `detectedTestFiles` / `detectedDocFiles` additions, doc gaps, and **draft
   journeys** (persona + ordered steps referencing candidate slugs — abstract until
   apply, since `create_journey_step` needs real feature IDs that exist only after
   Phase 4).
5. **Consolidate in this main thread (not a subagent).** Dedup by slug, reuse the
   exact existing slug on a match (enables enrichment during apply), union the three
   detection arrays per slug, and keep grouping feature-level not function-level.
   Carry the merged draft-journey list forward to Phase 5.
6. **No silent caps.** When repo size trims the roster, `log` (tell the user) how
   many lenses ran and which were skipped — a capped scan must read as "capped on
   purpose," never as "covered everything." Same rule when a `> 500 file` repo is
   scanned at reduced breadth.
7. Present the refined candidate table (mark **seed** vs **fan-out** origin) plus a
   draft-journey preview. The user reviews/edits before you submit the scan.

### Phase 3: Create Ghost Scan

1. Call `ghost_scan` with `product_id`, the `candidates` array, `repo_url`, and `branch`. Each candidate carries its three detection arrays — populate all of them, and never omit `detectedTestFiles` or `detectedDocFiles`:

   ```json
   {
     "slug": "authentication",
     "title": "Authentication",
     "componentSlug": "auth",
     "confidenceScore": 0.8,
     "detectedSourceFiles": ["src/auth/login.ts", "src/auth/session.ts"],
     "detectedTestFiles": ["src/auth/login.test.ts", "src/auth/session.spec.ts"],
     "detectedDocFiles": ["docs/auth.md"],
     "securityClassification": "restricted"
   }
   ```

2. **Pre-submit self-check.** Sum `detectedTestFiles` **and** `detectedDocFiles` across all candidates. If the Phase 2 walk surfaced test or doc files but either sum is 0 — or far below what you saw — the per-candidate mapping is broken: STOP and re-glob each candidate's source dirs (steps 6–7) before submitting. Importing source without its tests or docs understates real maturity and skews release gates.
3. Output: "Scan created with {n} candidates ({x} high, {y} medium, {z} low confidence), {t} tests and {d} docs mapped across candidates. Ready for review."

### Phase 4: Batch Review & Apply

1. Call `ghost_get_candidates` to load all candidates
2. Present candidates as a confidence-grouped table:

```
### High Confidence (>= 0.7) — 12 candidates
 # | Slug              | Component  | Tests | Docs | Source
 1 | auth-login        | auth       | 3     | 1    | 5
 2 | user-profile      | users      | 2     | 1    | 3

### Medium Confidence (0.4-0.7) — 5 candidates
13 | api-middleware     | middleware | 0     | 0    | 4

### Low Confidence (< 0.4) — 3 candidates
18 | config-loader     | infra      | 0     | 0    | 1
```

   **Scan the Tests column before approving.** If it reads 0 for candidates that clearly own source files, the scan missed test detection — do not approve blindly. Return to Phase 2 step 6, re-glob, and re-create the scan. An all-zero Tests column on a repo that has tests is a detection bug, not a property of the code.

   **Scan the Docs column too.** Same rule: if it reads 0 for candidates whose modules ship READMEs or `docs/*.md`, doc detection was skipped — return to Phase 2 step 7, re-glob, and re-create the scan. An all-zero Docs column on a repo that has docs is a detection bug, not a property of the code.

3. Offer batch operations:
   - "Approve all high confidence" — approve all >= 0.7
   - "Reject all low confidence" — reject all < 0.4
   - "Reject specific: #13, #18" — reject individually
   - "Approve all" / "Reject all"
   - "Tell me more about #13" — detail view for individual decision
4. Execute `ghost_batch_review` with `approve_ids` and `reject_ids` arrays to process all decisions in a single call. Optionally provide `reject_reason` for rejected candidates.
5. If at least 1 approved: call `ghost_apply` with `enrich_existing=true` if the product already has features (check Phase 1 feature list). Use `enrich_existing=false` only for the very first scan on an empty product.
6. Summary: "{n} features created, {e} features enriched, {m} components created, {t} tests linked, {d} docs linked, {s} source files linked"
7. **Backfilling a scan that missed tests.** If features were already created with zero linked tests, do NOT re-create them. Re-run Phase 2 with co-located test globbing, create a fresh scan that **reuses the exact existing slugs**, approve, and call `ghost_apply` with `enrich_existing=true` — apply matches by slug and attaches the newly detected tests to the existing features, no duplicates. This costs ~2 calls per module (scan + apply) instead of one `link_test` per test file.

### Phase 5: Journey Discovery & Creation

User journeys are a release gate (journey health), yet a brownfield import never gets
them — close that gap here, **after `ghost_apply`**, when features have real ZEN IDs.
This mirrors `/zensu:bootstrap` Step 2.

1. Call `list_features` with `product_id` and `view=compact` and build a
   slug → ZEN-ID map from the just-applied features.
2. Take the draft journeys consolidated in Phase 2b. Resolve each draft step's
   candidate slug to a real `feature_id` via the map. Drop any step whose slug was
   rejected or not applied, and `log` what was dropped (no silent omission).
3. Dedup against the existing journeys loaded in Phase 1 — do not re-propose a
   journey that already exists.
4. Present the proposed journeys as a table (title, persona, ordered steps →
   features). The user edits/approves before creation.
5. On approval, mirror the bootstrap mechanic:
   - `suggest_journeys` for product context.
   - `create_user_journey` per approved journey (`title`, `slug`, `journey_type`,
     `priority`, `persona`).
   - `create_journey_step` per step (`step_order` 1-based, `feature_id`,
     `interaction_type` ∈ action|navigation|input|validation|output|wait,
     `is_critical`).
   - `analyze_journey_health` on each created journey; report weak links to the user.

### Phase 5b: Baseline Revision (seat each feature at Stage 1)

A discovered feature is already *built*, but `ghost_apply` creates no revision — so
its history is empty and there is no build-out Stage 1 to grow from. Close that gap
here, **after `ghost_apply`**, when features have real ZEN IDs. Revisions are a
feature's build-out *stages over time*; subfeatures are its structural *parts*.

1. Reuse the slug → ZEN-ID map from Phase 5 (or rebuild it via `list_features`
   `view=compact`).
2. For each **newly created** feature, call `create_revision` (skip any that already
   carry a revision — e.g. enriched features; check via `get_feature_history` if
   unsure):
   - `scope_summary`: "Discovered baseline @ `{branch}` (ghost-scan)"
   - `scope_details`: the detected boundary — its `detectedSourceFiles`,
     `detectedTestFiles`, `detectedDocFiles`
   - `estimated_effort`: the candidate's effort estimate
   - `coverage_target`: derive from test presence (tests detected → a meaningful
     target; none → leave low/unset)
   - `created_by`: "mcp"
3. Report: "{n} features seated at v1 baseline." These are Stage 1 — they can fan
   out later into deeper revisions (`create_revision` v2…) and subfeatures
   (`add_subfeature`).

### Phase 6: Summary & Next Steps

1. List created features via `list_features` with `product_id` and `view=compact`.
2. Report counts: features created/enriched, tests linked, docs linked, journeys
   created, and journey-health weak links from Phase 5.
3. **Doc-gap report.** List the created/enriched features with zero docs (empty
   `detectedDocFiles`). Recommend `/zensu:implement` to author code-grounded docs
   for them — ghost-scan links existing docs but never generates new ones
   (`docs/documentation-guide.md`).
4. Recommend next steps:
   - `/zensu:implement` for feature implementation
   - `/zensu:security-review` for security classification
   - `generate_claude_md` for an updated CLAUDE.md
5. **Hybrid — capture planned-but-unbuilt features.** If the repo also has a
   forward-looking plan/vision doc, diff it against the features just created. For
   each plan item with no matching feature, `create_feature` with `status=planned`
   — these are genuinely unbuilt (no v1 baseline yet; they get one at
   implement-time). This completes the "built + planned" picture that neither a
   pure scan nor a pure bootstrap captures alone.
